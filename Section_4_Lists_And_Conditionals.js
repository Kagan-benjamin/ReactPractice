/*
.Javascript ternary conditionals can be injected using JSX in order to
conditionally render various templates (see App.js line 80)

.Conditionals can be built into the render() function of class components 
using standard javascript, then implemented with JSX in the return statement.

.When passing arguments within a method that is passed as props, like a 
click handler that accepts an index, make sure to pass the reference with 
an anonymous callback:
 click={() => this.handleDelete(idx)}

 .ALWAYS UPDATE STATE IN AN IMMUTABLE FASHION (build new state w/ spread)
