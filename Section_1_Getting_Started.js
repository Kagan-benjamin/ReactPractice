/*    
What is React?
.A javascript library for building user interfaces
.User interfaces are built with smaller Components
.Splitting components = separation of concerns, modular. Custom HTML elements
.Maintable, managable, reusable pieces = components.

.Examples: React, Udemy websites

Why React?
.UI state becomes difficult to handle with vanilla javascript.
.Focus on business logic, not on preventing app from crashing. Efficient.
.React features a huge ecosystem and active community. High performance.

React Alternatives:
-AngularJS
-VueJS
*jQuery (not full alternative, focuses on targeting DOM elements)

                      Single vs Multi-page:

.Only 1 html page, content (re)rendered on Client
-Page split into components all managed by root component
-Typically only 1 ReactDOM.render() call

.Multiple html pages, content rendered on Server
-html code + widgets (img library)
-One ReactDOM.render() call per widget
